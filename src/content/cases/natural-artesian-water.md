### **Drawn by the Island. Not Designed in a Lab.**

Our story begins deep beneath Hawai‘i — where rainfall from the upper slopes of Mauna Loa seeps slowly through layers of volcanic rock. As it moves, the lava’s natural porosity filters and enriches it with minerals, creating a smooth, clean taste unique to the island.

Over time, this naturally purified water gathers below ground in a sealed artesian aquifer — protected by layers of rock and held under natural pressure. When it’s ready, it rises on its own through that pressure, emerging cool and untouched by human hands.
No pumps. No mechanical force. Just gravity, rock, and time working in harmony.

That’s what artesian truly means — water brought to the surface by nature itself.

### **The Difference You Can Taste**

Some bottled waters start as tap — filtered, processed, and rebranded to sound pure.
We don’t filter tap water, add some marketing buzz, and sell it for a lot of money.

We start with something the earth has already finished — water that’s naturally refined by 13,000 feet of volcanic rock, balanced by minerals, and sealed within its own underground chamber.

We simply bottle it as it emerges from the artesian source — no tankers, no rerouting, no reinvention.

Authentic by Nature. Honest by Choice.

Every drop of Hawaiian Springs water comes from one protected source, deep within the island’s natural aquifer system.
It’s not blended, not altered, and not shipped across oceans to be rebottled.

It’s drawn where it’s born — volcanic, vital, and unmistakably Hawaiian.

### **Never Filtered Tap. Never Tankered.**
Hawai‘i’s original bottled water — the only one bottled at the source.
