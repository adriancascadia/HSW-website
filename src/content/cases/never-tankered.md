### **Does Your Bottled Water Have More Frequent Flyer Miles Than You?**
**The Truth About “Tankered” Water — and Why We Never Do It**

Some bottled waters log more miles than the people who drink them.

They’re pumped into giant plastic tankers, hauled hundreds or even thousands of miles, and re-bottled somewhere far from where they were sourced — often in a different state or even a different country.

Some brands even ship their water out of Hawaii in bulk, bottle it on the mainland, and send it right back to start the “local” distribution process. Imagine that — your “Hawaiian” water has already crossed the Pacific twice before it reaches a single shelf.

**We don’t do that.**

**We never have.**

**Our water is Never Tankered™.**

Bottled at the Source. Always.

Our spring water is captured and bottled right where it flows from volcanic rock, untouched by tankers, pipelines, or bulk transfer depots. No unnecessary journeys. No middlemen. Just nature — preserved in its original state.

### **Taste the Difference of Staying Home**

By staying bottled at the source, our water keeps its original mineral balance, freshness, and taste — the way nature intended.
Fewer miles. Less energy. Zero compromise.

Because water shouldn’t need a passport stamp before it reaches your glass.
