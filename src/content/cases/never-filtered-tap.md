### They say all bottled water is the same.
### **Not really.**

Some of it’s just filtered tap — and some is even shipped in tanks to be bottled somewhere else.

### Hawaiian Springs is different.

Rain falls on Hawaii’s Big Island and journeys through 13,000 feet of volcanic rock, picking up natural minerals along the way.

We bottle it right where it rises — never tankered, never reprocessed.

That’s why it’s authentic. Pure. Truly Hawaiian.

Hawaiian Springs is the only Hawaiian Artesian water bottled at the source.

### **Not filtered tap. Never tankered.**

**Know your water. Choose authenticity.**
